                A combination of distance education and computer education, online learning combines flexibility and
                interactivity.
                The way online learning works is that students can sign up for a course and progress at their own pace,
                often with self-assessment systems and instant feedback. Using this method, you can bridge the gap
                between
                you and an expert in a new and exciting way.
                Instead of just reading a book, taking notes, or watching a video, you are there in the moment with the
                so-called “live” person. This experience brings the content to life. And when something is brought to
                life,
                it makes it much easier to remember.
